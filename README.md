# Hf-and-Nd-evolution-in-the-mantle
A new geochemical box model with finite-time mixing effect incorporated

Use the main code “eHf_eNd_uNd_evolution_CHURCase.m” and “eHf_eNd_uNd_evolution_CaroCase.m” to run the model for the scenarios of a homogeneous primitive mantle and heterogeneous primitive mantle, respectively.

Please add all the functions and data files into the path before you run the code.
